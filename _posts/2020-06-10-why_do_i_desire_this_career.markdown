My why starts with my family and end with a life long dream. My family is one of the things that motivate me to continue to grow and learn. While having a 6 year old watching me daily. I have to continue to show her the best practices of growth in life, to accomplish what you desire. I have desired to secure a technical career since I graduated in high school in 2007. While searching for that desire I found a love for coding and designing. Now is my opportunity and I plan to make the most of it.
